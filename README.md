# amusing-resume
This repo is for making a website for my resume/CV.


Step 1 - Ask ChatGPT to help me do this in typescript because I'm not sure how to set it up myself.

- Download TS from the websites
- connect VSC path to my desktop so I can run the nodes in my github terminal not just my desktop powershell
 <!-- $env:Path += ";C:\Program Files\nodejs" -->

<!-- Next step do this: 
npm install -g typescript -->
<!-- tsc 
(this compiles the typsecript file into a javascript file then that appears in dist/ folder. This is referenced in the last line of index.html to run the website) -->

<!-- npm install -g live-server 
(Use a local development server by installing a simple HTTP server globally)
This will open your default browser and serve your site on http://127.0.0.1:8080 (or another port).
Every time you make changes, it reloads automatically.
