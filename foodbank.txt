Project Scope of Volunteer Work
i. The Food Bank Singapore is committed to tackling food insecurity by redistributing surplus food to those in need, reducing hunger and minimizing food wastage. Their efforts support a wide range of beneficiaries, including low-income families, the elderly, and migrant workers, ensuring help reaches many segments of society facing food shortages.

ii. The main challenges are food insecurity and food wastage. Many individuals and families in Singapore lack access to sufficient and nutritious food, while large amounts of surplus food go to waste. The Food Bank Singapore bridges this gap by redistributing surplus food, supplemented by corporate donations, to those in need.

iii. The beneficiaries of The Food Bank Singapore include low-income families, elderly individuals, and migrant workers. These beneficiaries live in rent-controlled flats or other heartland areas where they don't have access to proper nutrition and the project aims to improve their quality of life by providing essential food supplies.

iv. As a Bundle Leader, I play a key role in facilitating a group of volunteer donors through the entire process of packing and distributing food bundles directly to beneficiaries. This role involves briefing the volunteers, coordinating the packing of bundles and leading the door-to-door distribution. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZY9B3vu8XY
Additionally, I will participate in Food Drive campaigns, which typically last 10-12 hours. These events focus on raising awareness about food insecurity and wastage, where I help Foodbank logistics related to food redistribution, packaging, and delivering food to specific community locations.
Frequency: I will volunteer at least 3 hours per weekend event, with additional time for Food Drive campaigns based on Foodbank's event schedules. I will continue to volunteer on these projects and any ad-hoc events Foodbank requires volunteers for, until I clear all 80 hours.

v. Goal 2: Zero Hunger – The project directly contributes to reducing hunger by providing food to those in need. This will be done via redistributing food to minimized the food wastage problem, addressing the root cause of hunger and food insecurity.
Goal 3: Good Health and Wellbeing - This initiative aims to improve the health and well-being of beneficiaries by providing them with a balanced diet, thus addressing the nutritional deficits they face due to socioeconomic constraints.
Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities – By focusing on food redistribution, this project seeks to close the gap between those who have excess food and those facing food insecurity, promoting greater equity within the community. This is because food insecurity disproportionately affects vulnerable populations in Singapore.
Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production – The project also tackles the issue of food wastage. The UNSDG stated that each person wastes about 120kg of food per year but this project aims to promote sustainability by redistributing surplus food, reducing waste, and fostering a more responsible food system.

vi. Personally, I recognize that I have been privileged to live in a home without people outside my family and having meals taken for granted. I hope to deepen my understanding of food insecurity and the logistics behind food redistribution. I want to learn from the perspectives of both beneficiaries and volunteers, and explore how resources are mobilized to serve the community.
The project provides immediate relief to those in need, improving their quality of life. On a broader scale, it raises awareness about food insecurity, promotes responsible consumption, and encourages more community-driven initiatives, like local food drives. For example, some community centres Foodbank partners with, organize their own food drives to collect food to redistribute within their neighbourhood.

vii. Measurable service outcome: Redistribute 3 tons of food and support 300 families over the course of the project. This outcome seems like a lot but I believe it is possible throughout the course of this project.
Learning outcomes: Gain insights into the scope of food insecurity and the socioeconomic challenges faced by beneficiaries, as well as a deeper understanding of food redistribution logistics. Additionally, I aim to strengthen my community involvement and awareness in Singapore.


Reflection Report (at least 100 words)

What?
Report on your community service project objectively. What did you observe about the beneficiary community your project was engaging? What issue/needs in the community was being addressed by your project? What specific skills have you used at your community site?
Ans: My CSP works in a unique way that there is no designated location or beneficiary in particular to engage but rather we partnered with local community centres and external companies to provide assistance to those in need of proper nutrition. For example, I’ve volunteered at Boon Lay CC where we deliver food bundles to residents in the area and the volunteers who worked with me were from different companies like Jumbo Seafood, Point72, Church groups, etc. The volunteers came from any well meaning organizations or groups that wanted to contribute their time and money to helping these people in need. I relied on my interpersonal skills to build rapport with different volunteer teams and coordinated event logistics with the community center staff. Time and people management skills also came into play as I had to ensure we packaged the food and delivered them within a limited timeframe of 3 hours so that participants would be willing to return to serve with Foodbank again.




So What?
Analyse the experience. How was the experience different from what you expected? How did the project address the needs/issues in the community? What did you learn about the people/community? What did you do that seemed to be effective or ineffective in the community?

Ans: I think it was very fruitful and gave me a sense of gratitude far greater than I imagined. I expected to help a few people and call it a day but actually delivering packages to people allowed me to experience heartfelt appreciation from some beneficiaries who had not interacted with people in ages. They were so heartwarming and sweet as they accepted our food bundles and shared their experiences. 

I was exposed to new perspectives as many beneficiaries lived in rental flats shared with unfamiliar tenants/ strangers, highlighting not only food insecurity but also deep social isolation. They were not bad people, but they just did not have a support system to provide for their nutritional needs and social interaction. 

I found that beyond just delivering food, just spending some time listening to the beneficiaries’ stories and making a human connection was very fulfilling for the volunteers as well as the residents we were trying to help. This only worked when I explained the purpose of our volunteering efforts to the volunteers before they delivered the food so they could do it with meaning and compassion. For groups that just wanted to complete the activity as soon as possible, trying to get them to appreciate the impact they were making on these needy individuals was especially difficult. This showed me how important it is to set the tone and purpose before engaging in service.

Now What?
Consider the future impact of the experience on you and the community. What have you learned about yourself, the community, and the social issue in this experience? How may you apply your learning to other contexts? If you could do the project again, what would you do differently? What follow-up is needed to address the challenges/difficulties faced by the community? Do you have any plans to continue your involvement with this community or social issue? How do you intend to do so?

Ans: I believe that this may not be the most transformative and glamorous CSP but no matter what we do for the community, there are benefits. I immersed myself in the perspective of these beneficiaries and realized how much they actually needed and appreciated our support. 

I felt like until this point in my life, I hadn’t really contributed back to society so this experience served to bolster the need for me to give back and volunteer in any ways I can in the future. I’m thankful for the chance to work with the Foodbank team, who were kind, family-oriented, and passionate about their mission. 

I hope to continue volunteering with them even after I start my career. The community in need still faces a lot of challenges because food aid isn’t consistent, and some areas lack the resources or volunteers to organize food drives. However, access to proper nutrition should be a daily right instead of one-off events. Having seen many different kinds of food drive events, I have grown to appreciate the good samaritans in Singapore and I also hope to inspire future generations to give back as the Foodbank team inspired me.
